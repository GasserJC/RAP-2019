# RAP-2019

1/23/20

started the name gender guess ml program
data will be in seperate file.

the expiremental code compiles but my training or the model.fit() function I cannot seem to find the correct way to do it.


ISSUES:
the data set becomes alphabetical and has long amounts of just male or female, so the experimental code is poor as the first 24000 is most common and the last 12000 is very uncommon names. We need to figure out a way to randomize the entire dataset without distubing its male female designation.
